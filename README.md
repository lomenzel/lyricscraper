# lyricscraper
The goal of this program is to provide a simple way to scrape lyrics from the web. Just point it to a directory and let it rip. By default, it 
downloads txt files next to the song files. If configured via settings.ini, you can have it also write to IDv3 tags for lyrics. This isn't supported by all media 
players, but nice to have. 

## Requirements
- Chrome installed
- chromedriver.exe next to this executable/script (on run, it may open a console. It's only used for one scraper.)

## Note
This program was only tested and built for Windows, but should work on linux if built that way ()

# TODO
- Post summary screen with missed, successful scrapes.
